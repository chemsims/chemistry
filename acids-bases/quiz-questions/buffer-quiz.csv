What would be the equilibrium constant for this reaction below?

H_2_CO_3_ ⇄ $2H^+^ + CO_3_^2-^$


",medium,,,,2.12x10^-17^,"H_2_CO_3_ ⇄ 2H^+^ + CO_3_^2-^

2,BUFFER-02,Which would be the concentration of hydroxide ions for a $0.08 M$ solution of a weak base NaCN (The Kb for CN^-^ is 2.0 x10^-5^),easy,,,,[OH^-^] = 1.26x10^-3^ M,"The dissociation of the weak base CN^-^ in water would go as follows (consider that NaCN as a soluble salt dissociates entirely in water):

CN^-^ + H_2_O ⇄ HCN + OH^-^

Considering ""X"" as the amount of CN^-^ that attracts the H^+^ ions from water, we can write the Kb expression for this weak acid as:

Kb = [HCN][OH^-^]/[CN^-^]
Kb = (X)(X)/(0.08 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.08 - X)$ as 0.08. Solving for X: $X = √[CN^-^]Kb$ Replacing the values:

X = √(0.08 x 2x10^-5^)

3,BUFFER-03,"A student prepares 2 solutions of NaOH (strong base). One of them is a $450 mL$ solution at a concentration of $0.120 M$ and the other one is a $200 mL$ solution at a concentration of 0.200 M.

The student proceeds to mix both solutions at add water until it reaches $1 L$. What would be the pH of said mixture?",medium,,,,13.0,"In a $450 mL$ solution of $0.120 M NaOH$, we can determine how many moles of NaOH (or OH^-^ which are the same because it's a strong base) are present initially:

Moles of OH^-^ = 0.450 x 0.120
Moles of OH^-^ = 0.054 moles

In the other $200 mL$ solution of $0.200 M NaOH$, we can do the same thing:

Moles of OH^-^ = 0.200 x 0.200
Moles of OH^-^ = 0.040 moles

When mixed together, there is a total amount of moles of:

Total Moles = 0.054 + 0.040
Total Moles = 0.094 moles

These moles, after adding the water, are in a $1 L$ solution, making up for a concentration of OH^-^ ions of $0.094 M$. Given the pH equation: $pH = 14 -(-log([H^+^]))$, let's just replace

What would be true about a $0.1 M$ solution of this weak acid?


",hard,,,,[H_2_A] > [H^+^] > [HA^-^] > [A^2-^],"The steps for the overall reaction are:

H_2_A ⇄ HA^-^ + H^+^
HA^-^ ⇄ A^2-^ + H^+^

Without needing to make calculations, we know that a weak acid only dissociates a little, so from the get-go H_2_A should be the substance with higher concentration in the solution. Since the H^+^ is present in both steps as a product, its concentration should be the second highest.

For diprotic acids, the first step is more favored towards its products than the second step, and by looking at the Ka of each step we can determine that [HA^-^] should be higher than [A^2-^], especially since this last one is a product of the dissociation of the HA^-^.
