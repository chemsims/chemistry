14,TITRATION-14,Consider a monoprotic weak acid solution of $50 mL$ at a concentration of $0.500 M$. $30 mL$ of a strong base with the same molarity is added slowly to the solution. Where would be this particular point in the titration curve below?,medium,,,,Between points 2 and 3,"In a $50 mL$ solution of $0.500 M HA$, we can determine how many moles of HA are present initially:

Moles of OH^-^ = 0.03 x 0.500

Since the neutralization reaction is one to one, then $0.015 moles$ of the acid would be neutralized by adding the base, which results in the same amount of moles of A^-^ (conjugate base) to be produced. So after the addition:

Moles of HA = 0.010 moles
Moles of A^-^ = 0.015 moles
Moles of OH^-^ = 0

So more than half of the HA moles have been neutralized, to the point that the A^-^ ions are at a higher concentration than the weak acid, meaning that it's passed point 2 the half-equivalence point but not at the equivalence point yet since $0.010 moles$ of the acid are still left to be neutralized.

24,TITRATION-24,"A student prepares a $200 mL$ solution of $0.01 M Ba(OH)_2_$ in a beaker and titrates it with $0.06 M HCl$. After the addition of $100 mL$ of the titrant, what would the pH of the solution?",medium,,,,2.17,"In a $200 mL$ solution of $0.01 M Ba(OH)_2_$, we can determine how many moles of OH^-^ are present initially:

Moles of OH^-^ = 0.05 x 0.100 x 2. Note: Each mole of this strong acid results in 2 moles of OH^-^.
Moles of OH^-^ = 0.004 moles

In the $100 mL$ added of $0.06 M HCl$, we can do the same thing:

Moles of H^+^ = 0.06 x 0.100
Moles of H^+^ = 0.006 moles

Because H^+^ and OH^-^ ions react with each other to produce water, it's said that they're neutralized by each other, following this reaction: $OH^-^ + H^+^ → H_2_O$.

To determine what's left after this reaction:

Moles left = 0.006 - 0.004
Moles left of H^+^ = 0.002 moles

Let's calculate the concentration of ions in the solution:

[H^+^] = Moles of H^+^ / Total Volume
[H^+^] = 0.002 / (0.100 + 0.200)
[H^+^] = 0.0066 M

Given the pH equation:

pH = -log[H^+^]
pH = -log(0.0066)
pH = 2.17",,2,"Remember to sum up the volumes together. Initially there was $0.200 L$ of base and then $0.100 L$ was added, coming to a total of $0.300 L$.",,1.87,This is not the pH of the solution.

27,TITRATION-27,"A student prepares a $200 mL$ solution of $0.300 M HA (hypothetical weak acid)$ in a beaker and titrates it with $0.100 M KOH$. After the addition of $100 mL$ of the titrant, what would the pH of the solution be? (Note: The Ka of HA is 6.0x10^-5^).",medium,,,,3.5,"In a $200 mL$ solution of $0.300 M HA$, we can determine how many moles of HA are present initially:

Moles of HA = 0.200 x 0.300
Moles of HA = 0.06 moles

In the $100 mL$ added of $0.100 M KOH$, we can do the same thing:

Moles of OH^-^ = 0.100 x 0.100
Moles of OH^-^ = 0.01 moles

The acid HA reacts with the strong base KOH and gets neutralized, following this reaction:

KOH + HA → H_2_O + KA

Initially, there are:

Moles of KOH = 0.01 moles
Moles of HA = 0.06 moles
Moles of KA (or A^-^) = 0

After the neutralization reaction, what's left is:

Moles of KOH = 0
Moles of HA = 0.05 moles
Moles of KA (or A^-^) = 0.01 moles

Knowing this, we consider how the remaining HA dissociates:

HA ⇄ H^+^ + A^-^

Considering ""X"" as the amount of HA that gets dissociated into its ions, we can write the Ka expression for this weak acid as:

Ka = [H^+^][A^-^]/[HA]
Ka = (X)(0.01 + X)/(0.05 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.01 + X)$ as 0.01 and $(0.05 - X)$ as 0.05. Solving for X: $X = Ka[HA]/[A^-^]$. Replacing the values:

X = 6x10^-5^(0.01)/(0.05) (Note: In this case since the volumes are equal, the direct values of the moles can be used)
X = 3.2x10^-4^ M

This is also the amount of hidronium ions that are now dissolved in the solution. Given the pH equation: $pH = -log([H^+^])$, let's just replace:

pH = -log(3.2x10^-4^)
pH = 3.5

Another more direct way to calculate it is using directly the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation when there is present of a weak acid/base conjugate pair:

pH = pKa + log ([A^-^]/[HA])
pH = -log(6x10^-5^) + log(0.01/0.05)
pH = 3.5 ",,2.5,This the value you've gotten if you calculated the dissociation of what was left of the weak acid without taking into account its conjugate base that's present after the neutralization reaction.,,4.2,This is not the pH of the solution.

28,TITRATION-28,"Consider a hypothetical weak acid H_2_A that is a diprotic acid with a Ka_1_ of 5.2x10^-10^ and for HA^-^ Ka_2_ of 3.1x10^-13^.  What would be the equilibrium constant for this reaction below?

Ka_1_ = 5.2x10^-10^

HA^-^ + H_2_O ⇄ H_2_A + OH^-^
Ka_2_ = 3.1x10^-13^

So we first determine the correspondant Kb for each step

Kb_1_ = Kw/Ka_1_
Kb_1_ = 10^-14^/5.2x10^-10^
Kb_1_ = 1.92x10^-5^

Kb_2_ = Kw/Ka_2_
Kb_2_ = 10^-14^/3.1x10^-13^
Kb_2_ = 0.0322

So for the overall reaction:
