Moles of H^+^ = 0.02 x 0.080
Moles of H^+^ = 0.0016 mole

Because H^+^ and OH^-^ ions react with each other to produce water, it's said that they're neutralized by each other, following this reaction:
$KOH + HCl → H_2_O + KCl$.

To determine what's left after this reaction:

Moles left = 0.005 - 0.0016
Moles left of OH^-^ = 0.0034 moles

Let's calculate the concentration of ions in the solution:

[OH^-^] = Moles of OH^-^ / Total Volume
[OH^-^] = 0.0034 / (0.100 + 0.080)
[OH^-^] = 0.0188 M

Given the pH equation:

pH = 14 - (-log[OH^-^])
pH = 14 - (-log(0.0188))
pH = 12.27",,12.53,"Remember to sum up the volumes together.

21,PHSCALE-21,What would be the pH of a solution prepared with $0.120 M$ CH_3_COONa (salt)?. Consider the pKa for CH_3_COOH is 4.75.,medium,,,,8.91,"The Kb for the conjugate base of an acid is Kw divided by its Ka, so given how CH_3_COOH and CH_3_COO^-^:

Kb = 10^-14^/10^-4.75^

Considering ""X"" as the amount of CH_3_COOH that gets dissociated into its ions, we can write the Ka expression for this weak acid as:

Ka = [H^+^][CH_3_COO^-^]/[CH_3_COOH]
Ka = (X)(X)/(0.160 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.160 - X)$ as 0.160. Solving for X: $X = √[CH_3_COOH]Ka$. Replacing the values: 

X = √(0.160 x 1.78x10^-6^)
X = 1.69x10^-3^ M

This is also the amount of hidronium ions that are now dissolved in the solution. Given the pH equation: $pH = -log([H^+^])$, let's just replace:

Considering ""X"" as the amount of HF that gets dissociated into its ions, we can write the Ka expression for this weak acid as:

Ka = [H^+^][F^-^]/[HF]
Ka = (X)(X)/(0.100 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.100 - X)$ as 0.100. Solving for X: $X = √[HF]Ka$ Replacing the values:

X = √(0.100 x 7.2x10^-4^)

pH = 2.07

Knowing this pH value, the desired pH would be 20% more than it:

pH = 2.48

In other words, the desired concentration of hydronium ions would be:

[H^+^] = 10^-2.48^
[H^+^] = 3.28x10^-3^ M

Once again, if HF were to be dissociated into water, and we take $3.28x10^-3^ M$ as the part of it that gets dissociated, we can assume ""Xo"" as the initial concentration of HF, and write the Ka expression:

7.2x10^-4^ = $(3.28x10^-3^)(3.28x10^-3^)$/(Xo - 3.28x10^-3^)

Solving for Xo: $Xo = 0.0182 M$

If at the beginning there was $0.100 L$ of water, we can calculate the moles:

Moles of HF = [HF] x Volume
Moles of HF = 0.100 x 0.100
Moles of HF = 0.0100 moles

The total volume to get to the desired concentration would be:

After the neutralization reaction, what's left is:

Moles of KOH = 0

Knowing this, we consider how the remaining HA dissociates:

Considering ""X"" as the amount of HA that gets dissociated into its ions, we can write the Ka expression for this weak acid as:

Ka = [H^+^][A^-^]/[HA]
Ka = (X)(0.01 + X)/(0.04 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.01 + X)$ as 0.01 and $(0.04 - X)$ as 0.04. Solving for X: $X = Ka[HA]/[A^-^]$. Replacing the values:

X = 6x10^-5^(0.01)/(0.04). (Note: In this case since the volumes are equal, the direct values of the moles can be used).
