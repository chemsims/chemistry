Kb = [HCN][OH^-^]/[CN^-^]
Kb = (X)(X)/(0.08 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.08 - X)$ as 0.08. Solving for X: $X = √[CN^-^]Kb$ Replacing the values:

One way to look at it is through the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation:

$pH = pKa + log([A^-^]/[HA])$

In which the  logarythmic element of the equation becomes 0 when $[A^-^] = [HA]$ given how $log(1) = 0$. When this is the case:

9,BUFFER-09,Consider a $100 mL$ solution of $0.500 M$ HF. Adding $100 mL$ of which of the following solutions would result in an equimolar buffer solution?,hard,,,,0.250 M NaOH,"Adding $100 mL$ of $0.250 M$ NaOH would result in the neutralization of some of the weak acid in the solution, like this:

$HF + NaOH → NaF + H_2_O$

Let's first calculate the initial moles of the weak acid:

Initial Moles of HF = Volume of HF x Molarity of HF
Initial Moles of HF = 0.1 x 0.500
Initial Moles of HF = 0.05 moles

To know the moles that are going to be neutralized, we part from the strong base data:

Moles Added of NaOH = Volume of NaOH x Molarity of NaOH
Moles Added of NaOH = 0.1 x 0.250
Moles Added of NaOH = 0.025 moles

Following the neutralization reaction, if $0.025 moles$ of NaOH neutralize $0.05 moles$ of HF, we're left with $0.025
moles$ of HF and $0.025 moles$ of F^-^, its conjugate base. Since this an equimolar mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, it can be called a buffer solution.

10,BUFFER-10,A monoprotic weak acid HA with $Ka = 2.7x10^-6^$ is used to prepare a $200 mL$ with a molarity of $0.3 M$. How many mililiters of $0.3 M$ KOH have to be added in order for the pH to be 9.4?,hard,,,,Exactly 200 mL,"In $200 mL$ of $0.3 M$ KOH there are:

Moles of KOH = 0.2 x 0.3
Moles of KOH = 0.06 moles

These would neutralize the $0.06 moles$ of HA entirely like this:

HA + KOH ⇄ KA + H_2_O

So by the end of the neutralization, there are going to be $0.06 moles$ of KA (or A^-^) dissolved in the sum of the volumes of the solutions.

[A^-^] = Moles of A^-^ / Total Volume
[A^-^] = 0.06 / (0.2 + 0.2)
[A^-^] = 0.15 M

The presence of this weak base would make the solution slightly basic:

A^-^ + H_2_O ⇄ HA + OH^-^

Considering ""X"" as the amount of A^-^ that attracts the H^+^ ions from water, we can write the Kb expression for this weak base as:

Kw/Ka = [HA][OH^-^]/[A^-^]
10^-14^/2.7x10^-6^ = (X)(X)/(0.15 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.15 - X)$ as 0.15. Solving for X: $X = √[A^-^]Kb$ Replacing the values:

X = √(0.15 x 3.704x10^-9^)
X = 2.355x10^-5^ M

This is also the concentration of hydroxide ions that are now dissolved in the solution. To calculate the pH:

pH = 14 - (-log[OH^-^])
pH = 14 - (-log(2.355x10^-5^))

Take into account HCN has a $Ka = 6.2x10^-10^$,hard,,,,9.9,"In a $300 mL$ solution of $0.200 M NaCN$, we can determine how many moles of NaCN are present initially:

Moles of NaCN = 0.300 x 0.200

In the $100 mL$ added of $0.100 M KOH$, we can do the same thing:

Moles of HCl added = 0.100 x 0.100
Moles of HCl added = 0.01 moles

The basic salt NaCN reacts with the strong acid HCl and gets neutralized, following this reaction:

NaCN + HCl → H_2_O + NaCl

Initially, there are:

Moles of HCl (or H^+^) = 0.01 moles
Moles of NaCN (or CN^-^) = 0.06 moles
Moles of HCN = 0

After the neutralization reaction, what's left is:

Moles of HCl (or H^+^) = 0
Moles of NaCN (or CN^-^) = 0.05 moles
Moles of HCN = 0.01 moles

Knowing this, we consider how the remaining NaCN dissociates into the weak base ion CN^-^:

CN^-^ + H_2_O ⇄ HCN + OH^-^

To quickly determine the pH of the solution we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = 14 - (pKb + log([HCN]/[CN^-^])
pH = 14 - (-log(10^-14^/6.2x10^-10^) + log(0.01/0.05))

$Initial Moles of NaCN (or CN^-^) = 0.300 x 0.200$ 
$Initial Moles of NaCN (or CN^-^) = 0.06 moles$

To know the moles that are going to be neutralized, we part from the strong acid data:

$Moles Added of HCl = Volume of HCl x Molarity of HCl$
$Moles Added of HCl = 0.050 x 0.600$
$Moles Added of HCl = 0.03 moles$

Following the neutralization reaction, if $0.03 moles$ of HCl neutralize $0.06 moles$ of NaCN, we're left with $0.03

Given that reaction, it takes 2 moles of HX to neutralize 1 mole of Y(OH)_2_, meaning that a total of $0.12 moles$ of HX is required. Parting from the concentration we can determine the volume:

Ka = Kw/Kb
Ka = 10^-14^/10^-9.25^

Considering ""X"" as the amount of CH_3_COO^-^ that attracts H^+^ ions to produce OH^-^ ions, we can write the Kb expression for this weak base as:

Kb = [H^+^][CH_3_COO^-^]/[CH_3_COOH]
Kb = (X)(X)/(0.160 - X)

Since X is a very small number, we can assume $(0.160 - X)$ as 0.160. Solving for X: $X = √[CH_3_COOH]Kb$. Replacing the values:

X = √(0.160 x 1.78x10^-5^)
X = 1.69x10^-3^
