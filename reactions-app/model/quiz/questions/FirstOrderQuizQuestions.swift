            The radioactive decay is a first order process. Given the data, using first order equation \
            (where A is just 131 I in this case):

            $[A] = [A_0_]e-^kt^$.

            After 16 days, the remaining of 131 I is 12.5% (100% - 75%) of the initial value, or 0.25[A_0_].

            Replacing in the equation: $[A_0_]e-^k(24)^ = 0.25[A_0_]$. Applying natural log to each side we \
            get: $ln([A_0_]e-^k(16)^) = ln(0.25[A_0_])$.

            Using logarithmic properties:

            $ln([A_0_]) + ln(e-^k(16)^) = ln[0.25A_0_]$ ‚ûù
            $ln([A_0_]) - k(16) = ln(0.25[A_0_])$.

            Clearing for k:

            $k = ln[A_0_] - ln(0.25[A_0_]) / 16$ ‚ûù
            $k = ln([A_0_]/0.25[A_0_]) / 16 = k$ ‚ûù
            $ln(1/0.25) / 16 = k$

            we get $k = 0.08666 d^-1^$. Now to determine half-life, we use the half-life equation \
            $t_1/2_ = ln(2) / 0.08666 d^-1^ = 8 days$.

                B can be inferred to be of first order by looking at how the concentration of it changed \
                from 0.40 to 0.20 in 2 hours ($0.10 M/h$) and then from 0.20 to 0.10 in 2 hours \
                ($0.05 M/h$). That means that on average the Rate was halved when the concentration of B was \
                halved too. To confirm this, you can apply first order equations of \
                $k = ln[A_0_] - ln[A] / t$ to calculate k using the data for each point, which will result \
